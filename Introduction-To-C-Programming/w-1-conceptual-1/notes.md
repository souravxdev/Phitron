    - Conditional Statements

- Problem Solving

- Writing Code = Writing Source Code
- Compiler -> Source Code -> Machine Code


- Data Type
    - কম্পিউটারকে বলতে হয়, আমি কোন ধরনের, কোন সাইজের data নিয়ে কাজ করবো।
    - Numbers, Characters, String, Boolean
    - int, long long int, float, double, char, bool
    - Premetive data type: Basic, built-in data types in programming languages that represent simple values like integers, booleans, characters, and floating-point numbers.
    - A memory address(0x7ffe5367e044) is a unique identifier for a specific location in a computer's memory.
    - We worked with signed integer.
    - int:
        - Size: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits), but can be 2 bytes on older systems.
        - Range (for 32-bit int): -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
        - Range (for 16-bit int): -32,768 to 32,767

- Variable

- Operators
    - Arithmatic
    - Relational
    - Logical
- Conditionals
